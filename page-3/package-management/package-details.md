# Package Details

![Package Details Page](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>)

This page will show detailed information for a single package in your environment and allows to manage its assignment to users and updates.

This page looks similiar to the [Package Store Details](../package-store/package-store-details.md) page, but gives details about a package that is already imported into your environment. It does not reflect the generic package store entry.

## Package Types

This page can display any package that is understood by RealmJoin Portal, this includes

* **Managed** and **Basic** packages from the package store, delivered via Intune
* **Unmanaged** packages in Intune (not from the package store)
* **RealmJoin Classic** "Choco" and "Craft" packages

Different types of packages have different levels of support to be managed via RealmJoin Portal at this point. This guide will focus on **Managed** and **Basic** packages from the package store as these are best supported currently.
