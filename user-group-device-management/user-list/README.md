# User List

![User List View](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (13) (1).png>)

This view offers you a simple way to search or review users in your environment.

### User Object Types

"Users" include:

* AzureAD user objects
* AzureAD external users, a.k.a. guests
* Shared mailboxes
* Room and Equipment mailboxes
* Administrative user accounts

### Search and Sort

The user list allows you to search for any user in your organization by

* DisplayName
* User Principal Name
* AzureAD Object ID
* Job Title
* City
* Country

The search supports realtime / as-you-type incremental search. The search results will update instantly as you type.

You can sort the current search result or the full list by any of the fields, by clicking on the fields name.

### Guests

By default, AzureAD external users ("Guests") are excluded. Switching the "Exclude guests" toggle will include them in the search/list.

### Drill Down to a User

Clicking the name of a user object will lead you to this [user's details page](user-details.md).
