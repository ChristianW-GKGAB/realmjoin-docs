![Device List View](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (9) (1) (1) (1).png>)

This view offers you a simple way to search or review devices in your environment.

### Object Types

The category "devices" includes:

* AzureAD joined clients, like modern workplace clients
* AzureAD registered devices, like user-owned phones and tablets
* Other devices, like printers used by MS Universal Printing or SurfaceHubs

### Search and Sort

The device list allows you to search for devices in your organization by

* Name
* AzureAD Object/Device ID
* Serial Number
* Manufacturer
* Model
* Operating System

The user interface allows to limit the results to "Only Desktop devices" which will exclude e.g. mobile phones and tablets. Also for managed devices, you can choose to limit the results according to their [compliance state](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/device-compliance-get-started) in Intune (MS Endpoint Manager).

The search support realtime / as-you-type incremental search. The search results will update instantly as you type.

You can sort the current search result or the full list by any of the fields, by clicking on the fields name.

### Drill down to a Device

Clicking the name of a device will lead you to this [device's details page](device-details.md).
