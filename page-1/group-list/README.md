# Group List

![Group List View](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png>)

This view offers you a simple way to search or review groups in your environment.

### Object Types

The category "groups" includes:

* AzureAD static and dynamic groups
* Exchange Online mail-enabled groups and distribution groups
* Microsoft Office365 groups and teams

### Search and Sort

The group list allows you to search for any AzureAD or Exchange Online group in your organization by

* Name
* AzureAD Object ID
* AzureAD Group Type

By default, only RealmJoin-realted groups like application assignment groups are displayed. Switching the "Only RealmJoin" toggle will include them in the search/list.

The search support realtime / as-you-type incremental search. The search results will update instantly as you type.

You can sort the current search result or the full list by any of the fields, by clicking on the fields name.

### Drill down to a Group

Clicking the name of a group object will lead you to this [user's details page](../user-list/user-details.md).
