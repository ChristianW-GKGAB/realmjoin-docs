# User List

![User List View](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png>)

The user list allows you to search for any user in your organization by

* DisplayName
* User Principal Name
* AzureAD Object ID
* Job Title
* City
* Country

By default, AzureAD external users ("Guests") are excluded. Switching the "Exclude guests" toggle will include them in the search.

The search support realtime / as-you-type incremental search. The search results will update instantly as you type.

You can sort the current search result or the full list by any of the fields, by clicking on the fields name.

Clicking the name of a user object will lead you to this [user's details page](user-details.md).
