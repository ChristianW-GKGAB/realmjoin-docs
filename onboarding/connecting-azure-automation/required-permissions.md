### RealmJoin Runbook Management <a href="#b31d828b-8bcb-45fc-8d72-5418777a5376" id="b31d828b-8bcb-45fc-8d72-5418777a5376"></a>

RealmJoin will create an Application Registration called **RealmJoin Runbook Management** which is used to update the [Azure Automation Runbooks](../../runbooks/) in your tenant based on [glueckkanja-gab's shared runbook repository](https://github.com/realmjoin/realmjoin-runbooks).&#x20;

This app also will be used by RealmJoin Portal to trigger runbook execution after filtering requests through [RealmJoin's RBAC](../../settings/permission.md) and [Runbook Permissions](../../runbooks/runbook-permissions.md).
